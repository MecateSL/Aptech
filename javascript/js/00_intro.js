	Javascript:
	
	It adds interactiviry to your static HTL pages.
	
	Javascript is a lightweight programming language. Any programming 
	language has statement or commands which tells computer or in
	this case the browser how to reacto or perform a certain action.
	
	A typical javascript statement is composed of functions, keywords,
	variables, comments, etc.
	
	Every statement in javascript must close with a semi-colon (;).
	
	You cn group statements together using a block { ... }.
	
	Javascript is case-sensitive and it uses camel-case, that means if
	you have two words -> 1st word's 1st letter will be lowercase and
	subsequent word's first letter is capital.
	
	Ex.: 
		backgroundColor
		getElementById
		
	Ir was invented by Charls Goldfarn in the year 1995. The official
	name of javascript is ECMA - 262 (European Computer Manufacturers 
	Association).
	
	Javascript can be directly embedded in you HTML pages or you can 
	create an external javacript file (.js) and can be linged to your
	HTML pages. External js is very useful when you have to run a code
	in different HTML pages.
	
	When you embed javascript in HTML pages it can be kept in head 
	section or body section but it is preferred to have all scripts
	at one place. Mostly we keep it in the body at the end.
	
	To create a function you must use te keyword function followed by 
	any name (apply naming rules) and followed by "()".
	
	function myFunction("parameter"){
		
		// Statements;
	}
	
	A function performs certain action based on the statements 
	mentioned inside the block.
